# C Power Function

A beginner-friendly C program that calculates the power of a number (`base^exponent`) using loops.  
Supports positive, zero, and negative exponents with decimal bases.

## Features
- Handles positive, zero, and negative exponents
- Works with decimal (floating-point) base numbers
- Simple loop-based logic, no math library needed
- Easy to understand and modify

## How It Works
1. The program asks for a base number.
2. Then asks for an exponent (power).
3. Uses a loop to multiply the base by the required number of times.
4. If the exponent is negative, it calculates the reciprocal of the result.

**Example Run:**
```
Enter your base number.

Now enter your power number.
